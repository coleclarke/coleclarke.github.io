      <h2>Loaves & Fishes: Strengthening Communities Through Food Security</h2>
      <p>Food pantries are where people may go to get free groceries when they cannot afford to buy food. They receive donations of canned foods, fresh produce and vegetables, and other items from individuals, businesses, and organizations, and redistribute them to struggling families. Food pantries tend to be run by churches, nonprofits, or community agencies, and offer a local way for people in need. They help reduce wastage of food by donating excess food and make sure all people in the society receive meals. Food pantries receive donations that help sustain this vital activity.
