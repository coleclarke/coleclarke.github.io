          <p> Food insecurity means not having reliable access to enough affordable, nutritious food to live a healthy and active life. It can range from worrying about running out of food before getting more money, to skipping meals or going days without eating due to lack of resources. It's not just about hunger it's about the uncertainty and stress of not knowing where your next meal will come from. In the US 13.5% of households face food insecurity.</p>

      <h2>Loaves & Fishes: Strengthening Communities Through Food Security</h2>
      <p>
        
        Food pantries are where people may go to get free groceries when they cannot afford to buy food. They receive donations of canned foods, fresh produce and vegetables, and house hold necessities from individuals, businesses, and organizations. These items are redistribute to families struggling from food insecuritys. Food pantries often are run by churches, nonprofits, or other community agencies, they offer a way for people in need to get food locally. Food  banks help reduce food wastage by giving a place for local resturants and grocery stores to donate excess food and make sure all people in the society receive meals. Food pantries receive donations that help sustain this vital activity.
